# Capstone-DA14: He Shoots He Scores

## Overview
In this project I am going to be analyzing how goal scoring has changed in the National Hockey League (NHL) from the 2007-08 season through the 2023-24 season.
I will be analyzing to see what has caused goal scoring to change and if there is a moment that can be pinpointed as when it changed.
